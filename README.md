Welcome to my personal portfolio! I'm a second-year student studying software engineering at the University of Western Ontario. I hold a passion for music, sports, and for technology and advancements in AI

## About Me
Entering University I had the goal of graduating with as much knowledge regarding software 
My work terms spent working as a student counsellor, or most recently as a Student Advancement Researcher at SickKids have allowed me to learn about how to work within a group environment to provide meaningful work. As an employee, these opportunities have allowed me to offer high-level communication, time-management skills, experience collaborating in various work teams, allowing me to fit seamlessly in group-work dynamics. I hope to bring forth this gained knowledge into my work in software development.

## Skills
- Java
- Python
- Html and CSS
